# ÖVERDRIFT

The ÖVERDRIFT desk lamp is an over-the-top firmware for a desk or bedside lamp. It runs on any Arduino board, Raspberry Pi Pico or other RP2040 based board.

The name ÖVERDRIFT is a play on IKEA furniture naming, while being the Swedish word for "exaggeration" (since this is supposed to be completely overkill for a simple lamp, you know).

## Main Features

* RGB LED Strip Support!
* Buttons!
* It is also a keyboard!

## Requirements

* Arduino or RP2040 microcontroller such as Raspberry Pi Pico, Adafruit KB2040, Sparkfun ProMicro
* 3D-printed parts:
  * All of the parts _**except** the base_ from [Simple Desk Lamp (on Thingiverse)](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2855826) by [Anuradha Gunawardana](https://www.thingiverse.com/LKBrilliant), use whatever colour you want.
  * Modified base part from [my remix on Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5478722).
